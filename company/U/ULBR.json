The Long LIBOR Index aims to approximate the daily performance of a hypothetical long investment in the composite forward LIBOR rate, as if the composite forward LIBOR rate itself were an asset that could be invested in. It does so by tracking the return on a hypothetical short position in Eurodollar futures contracts, where that position is recalibrated daily to result in a return over the next Index Business Day that approximates the percentage change in the composite forward LIBOR rate over that next day, subject to the long LIBOR floor.", "CEO": "", "issueType": "", "sector": "", "tags": []}
