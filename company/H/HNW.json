Floating rate loans 3. Insurance Linked Securities (also known as catastrophe bonds) These investments will involve significant risks as the fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in high yield debt securitisation, loans and preferred stocks. However, by investing in catastrophe bonds, the fund will hold a diversified portfolio and expose investors to an asset class that promises high reward; one in which they may not have had exposure to before.", "CEO": "Lisa Jones", "issueType": "cs", "sector": "Financial Services", "tags": ["Financial Services", "Asset Management"]}
