{"symbol": "VLU", "companyName": "SPDR S&P 1500 Value Tilt", "exchange": "NYSE Arca", "industry": "", "website": "http://www.spdrs.com", "description": "The investment seeks investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P 1500 Low Valuation Tilt Index.\n The fund employs a sampling strategy in seeking to track the index. It generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index applies an alternative weighting methodology to the S&P Composite 1500 Index so that stocks with relatively low valuations (i.e., relatively \"cheap\") are overweight relative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index and stocks with relatively high valuations are underweight. The fund is non-diversified.", "CEO": "", "issueType": "", "sector": "", "tags": []}
