The Short LIBOR Index aims to approximate the daily performance of a hypothetical short position in the composite forward LIBOR rate, as if the composite forward LIBOR rate itself were an asset that could be shorted. It does so by tracking the return on a hypothetical long position in Eurodollar futures contracts, where that position is recalibrated daily to result in a return over the next Index Business Day that approximates the inverse of the percentage change in the composite forward LIBOR rate over that next day, subject to the short LIBOR floor.", "CEO": "", "issueType": "", "sector": "", "tags": []}
