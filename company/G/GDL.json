{"symbol": "GDL", "companyName": "GDL Fund The of Beneficial Interest", "exchange": "New York Stock Exchange", "industry": "", "website": "http://www.gabelli.com", "description": "Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in securities or hedging arrangements relating to companies involved in corporate transactions or reorganizations, giving rise to the possibility of realizing gains upon or within relatively short periods of time after the completion of such transactions or reorganizations. This policy is not fundamental and may be changed by the Fund with notice of not less than 60 days to its shareholders. In market cycles with scarce transaction opportunities, the Fund may seek to accomplish its objective of achieving absolute returns by temporarily investing in other assets, including, but not limited to, short-term debt securities, which may make it less likely for the Fund to achieve an attractive rate of return. As a global fund, the Fund may invest without limitation in the securities of foreign and domestic issuers. The Funds investment strategy is to invest in merger arbitrage transactions and corporate reorganizations throughout the world. Under normal market conditions, the Fund expects to have at least 40% of its assets invested in at least three countries, other than the United States. To the extent that the majority of mergers, takeovers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts and corporate reorganizations are concentrated in any given geographic region, such as Europe, North America or Asia, a relatively high proportion of the Funds assets may be invested in that particular region.", "CEO": "", "issueType": "cs", "sector": "", "tags": ["Financial Services", "Asset Management"]}
