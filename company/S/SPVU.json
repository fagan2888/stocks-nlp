The underlying index is designed to track the performance of approximately 100 stocks in the S&P 500\u00ae Index that have the highest \"value score,\" which the index provider calculates based on fundamental ratios of a company's stock. A value stock tends to trade at a lower price relative to such fundamentals and thus may be considered undervalued by investors.
