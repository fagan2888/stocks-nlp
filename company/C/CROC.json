It may also invest in forward contracts if the market for a specific futures contract experiences emergencies (e.g., natural disaster, terrorist attack or an act of God) or disruptions (e.g., a trading halt or a flash crash) that would prevent or make it impractical for the fund to obtain the appropriate amount of investment exposure to the affected futures contracts directly.", "CEO": "", "issueType": "et", "sector": "", "tags": []}
